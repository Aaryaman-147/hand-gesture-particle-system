# Gesture-Controlled 3D Particle System

An interactive, real-time 3D particle system built with Three.js and MediaPipe Hands, where hand gestures control generative particle structures using live webcam input.

The project transforms intuitive hand poses into visually distinct particle formations such as galactic vortices, Saturn rings, hearts, flowers, DNA helices, and spheres, with smooth transitions, dynamic colors, and responsive scaling — all rendered directly in the browser.

This project explores the intersection of computer vision, human–computer interaction, and procedural 3D graphics.
